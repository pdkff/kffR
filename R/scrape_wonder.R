# scrape_unemployment scrapes weekly unemployment data from:
# web address: https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp
# and outputs it as a dataframe:
# state (chr)
# week (date)
# InitialClaims (dbl)
# ContinuedClaims (dbl)
# CoveredEmployment (dbl)
# InsuredUnemploymentRate (dbl)
# Note: SHFs needs only the latest week's value, setting latestWeekOnly = FALSE pulls in all data available from the webform
